# **CSU33012 - Software Engineering**

## Biography of a Software Engineer
>To produce a short (2-4 page) biography of a key software engineer, discussing the work and impact of the individual.

## Lowest Common Ancestor Part 1
>To implement a function that can calculate the lowest common ancestor in a graph, that may be structured as a binary tree.

>Following completion of this first step, you should then add unit test code to each repository that tests the implementation . Grading awarded based on quality of test code.

## Lowest Common Ancestor Part 2
>Enhance your previous LCA solution, implementing as a branch that you must ultimately merge with your master branch, an implementation of LCA that can work for graphs structured in directed acyclic form. Details are available here.

## Measuring Software Engineering Report
>To deliver a report that considers the ways in which the software engineering process can be measured and assessed in terms of measurable data, an overview of the computational platforms available to perform this work, the algorithmic approaches available, and the ethics concerns surrounding this kind of analytics. A starting reading list is provided below. 10 pages.

## Accessing Respository REST API
> Integrate the GitHub API to retrieve and display data regarding the logged in developer: [Commit](https://github.com/ahmedhamedaly/CSU33012-GitHub-Visualiser/tree/d41c63a14028f3cd32e32e5bf00f8bfa0cd0505a) or [Release v1](https://github.com/ahmedhamedaly/CSU33012-GitHub-Visualiser/releases/tag/v1.0)

## Software Engineering Metric Visualisation Project
> Integrate the GitHub API to build a visualisation of data available that elucidates some aspect of the software engineering process, such as a social graph of developers and projects, or a visualisation of individual of team performance: [Commit](https://github.com/ahmedhamedaly/CSU33012-GitHub-Visualiser/) or [Release v2](https://github.com/ahmedhamedaly/CSU33012-GitHub-Visualiser/releases/tag/v2.0)
